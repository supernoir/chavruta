# Chavruta - Find your next study buddy

For centuries, Jewish children and grown-ups have learned sacred texts in pairs (Aramaic: Chavruta). This simple webapp aims to match up study partners that are interested in similar fields of study, locations and have a common level.

Of course this idea supports finding a "Chavruta" for learning ancient Jewish wisdom. But it is also possible to find friends for learning to code, speak chinese or bake chocolate chip cookies.
